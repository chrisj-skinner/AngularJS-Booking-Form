Pull requests are the way to go here. I apologise in advance for the slow action on pull requests and issues. I only have two rules for submitting a pull request: match the naming convention (camelCase, categorised [fades, bounces, etc]) and let us see a demo of submitted animations in a [pen](http://codepen.io). That last one is important.
